# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction

Background:

Customer retention is a critical issue in any industry, particularly for companies with a subscription-based business model, making it a relevant topic for machine learning students.

Problem:

Due to intense competition, telecommunications companies need to identify customers who might switch to a competitor. An accurate customer churn model is therefore necessary for the firms for customer relationship management. In this project, we will study suitable machine learning models for the task to achieve accurate telco customer churn prediction.

Data Source:

Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/customer-churn-prediction-2020/overview
Contains two datasets: the train.csv contains 4250 lines with 20 columns. 3652 samples belong to class churn=no, while 598 samples belong to class churn=yes. The test.csv contains 750 lines with 20 columns without the target variable "churnâ€œ.

Objectives:

To identify significant predictors for telco customer churn prediction
To evaluate the accuracy of machine learning algorithms used for telco customer churn prediction
To achieve an optimal algorithm for telco customer churn prediction
